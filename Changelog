Delocate change log
###################

`Matthew Brett` (MB) wrote most of the code.  Min Ragan-Kelley (MinRK) did a
lot of work discussing OSX things with MB, and contributes fixes too.

Releases
********

* 0.7.3 (Monday December 4th 2017

  Also deal with xcode 8.3 message from another binary file.

* 0.7.2 (Saturday December 2nd 2017

  Make compatible with latest Xcode error messages.

* 0.7.1 (Tuesday June 27th 2017)

  Fix broken tests from 0.7.0.

* 0.7.0 (Tuesday June 27th 2017)

  Add ability to deal with rpath.  Thanks to Kyle Stewart.

* 0.6.5 (Friday June 16 2017)

  More changes for compatibility with newer OSX Xcode messages.  Thanks to
  Sean Gillies.

  * more adaptations to chanages to output of ``otool``.

* 0.6.4 (Wednesday November 23 2016)

  Changes for compatibility with newer OSX.  Thanks to Tommy Sparber.

  * adapt to SIP file protections;
  * adapt to changes in otool output;
  * rebuild testing wheels for OSX 10.6 compatibility.

* 0.6.3 (Monday July 20 2015)

  * Inspect all files looking for linked libraries, instead of inspecting only
    files ending in library extensions.  This means that you will also pick up
    libraries for executables in the given path to delocate, by default, but
    is slower to execute. Thanks to Marc Abramowitz for the report and
    suggestion;
  * Remove silly check for library existence when delocating libraries that
    are in the tree to delocate.

* 0.6.2 (Monday November 10 2014)

  * Bugfix for zipfile unpacking losing permissions; This wiped out useful
    permissions like execute permissions for scripts when modifying zip files.

* 0.6.1 (Thursday October 23 2014)

  * Add some useful flags to ``delocate-add-platform``
  * Refactoring

* 0.6.0 (Saturday September 13 2014)

  * Add utility to add platform tags to wheel contents and name
  * Add more general wheel context manager
  * Some refactoring for neatness

* 0.5.0 (Tuesday July 22 2014)

  * Add utilities and script to apply a patch to a wheel
  * Add utilities and script to test for architectures in libraries and
    require named architectures
  * Docstring fixes and refactoring

* 0.4.0 (Wednesday June 25 2014)

  * Set ``install_name_id`` for copied libraries to be unique to this package.
    OSX uses the ``install_name_id`` to identify a library uniquely on the
    system.  If two libraries have the same ``install_name_id`` when loaded into
    the process, then OSX will raise an error unless their compatibility number
    matches.  Delocate now sets the ``install_name_id`` to be more or less
    unique with a Python process at least.  This means OSX won't raise an error
    if you have two different libraries in two different packages (e.g hdf5
    libraries in ``h5py`` and ``pytables``.
  * Turn on compression for creating wheel zip files. Previously we were zipping
    without compression (because MB didn't know that was the default).
  * Raise an error if delocating attempts to copy two different libraries with
    the same name (therefore overwriting one with the other).
  * Add command and functions to do architecture fuse between two different
    wheels. This can be useful when you have to build a 32-bit and 64-bit wheel
    separately. In that case you can fuse the two wheels making fat (combined)
    architecture libraries, using ``delocate-fuse``.  Add supporting routines
    for detecting architecture of libraries and fusing libraries with different
    architectures.
  * Add use of ``os.path.expanduser`` to specified output wheel directory for
    ``delocate-wheel`` script. Now flag input like ``delocate-wheel -w ~/wheels
    some_wheel.whl`` will correctly output to ``$HOME/wheels``.

* 0.3.0 (Monday May 5 2014)

  * Switch to using just ``@loader_path`` rather than a combination of
    ``@loader_path`` and ``@rpath`` for pointing to relocated libraries.  Using
    ``@rpath`` was giving some errors of form::

        "install_name_tool: changing install names or rpaths can't be redone
        for: libsomething.dylib (for architecture x86_64) because larger updated
        load commands do not fit (the program must be relinked, and you may need
        to use -headerpad or -headerpad_max_install_names)

    |--| presumably because ``@rpath`` had been zero length before we got to the
    library.
  * Add flag to display depending libraries as well as the libraries a tree /
    wheel depends on.
  * Use canonical paths for depended and depending library paths, including
    following symbolic links.  This means that two links pointing to the same
    file don't appear to be two different libraries, causing an error when
    copying the second into the directory containing the copied libraries.
  * Don't raise an error when delocating a wheel that was previously delocated
    (MinRK)

* 0.2.1 (Monday March 31 2014)

  Bugfix release

  * Rewrite wheel RECORD file when writing wheel.  Delocated wheels were
    breaking ``wheel unpack`` command.

* 0.2.0 (Tuesday March 25 2014)

  First public release
