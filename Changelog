Delocate change log
###################

Matthew Brett (MB) wrote most of the code.  Kyle Benesch (KB) did some heroic
refactoring of the dependency tracing and added type hinting. Isuru Fernando
(IF) developed the Universal2 (arm64) support. Min Ragan-Kelley (MinRK) did a
lot of work discussing OSX things with MB, and contributed fixes as well.

See `this Changelog site <https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0>`_ for helpful
rules on making a good Changelog.

Releases
********

* [Unreleased]

* [0.10.3] - 2022-11-04

  * Support for Python 3.6 has been dropped.
  * Delocate no longer depends on the ``wheel`` API.
  * Running Delocate on already delocated wheels will no longer corrupt them.
    [#157](https://github.com/matthew-brett/delocate/pull/157)

* [0.10.2] - 2021-12-31

  Bugfix and compatibility release.

  * Ensured support for versions of wheel beyond 0.37.1.  If you are using older
    versions of Delocate then you may need to to pin ``wheel==0.37.1``.
    [#135](https://github.com/matthew-brett/delocate/issues/135)
  * Fixed crashes when ``otool`` gives multiple architectures in its output.
    This does not support different dependencies per-architecture.
    [#130](https://github.com/matthew-brett/delocate/pull/130)

* [0.10.1] - 2021-11-23

  Bugfix release.

  * Delocate will no longer fail when libraries use different install names to
    refer to the same library.
    [#134](https://github.com/matthew-brett/delocate/pull/134)

* [0.10.0] - 2021-09-22

  First release that requires Python 3.

  * ``wheel_libs`` now supports recursive dependencies.
  * ``listdeps`` command now supports recursive dependencies.
    [#118](https://github.com/matthew-brett/delocate/pull/118)
  * Wheels with top-level extension modules or wheels using namespaces can now
    be delocated.
    [#123](https://github.com/matthew-brett/delocate/pull/123)
  * Wheels with multiple packages will no longer copy duplicate libraries.
    [#35](https://github.com/matthew-brett/delocate/issues/35)
  * ``delocate.tools.back_tick`` has been deprecated.
    [#126](https://github.com/matthew-brett/delocate/pull/126)

* [0.9.1] - 2021-09-17

  Bugfix release.

  * Fixed issue where Delocate would attempt to modify the install names of a
    non-copied library which dynamically links to a copied library.
    [#120](https://github.com/matthew-brett/delocate/pull/120)

* [0.9.0] - 2021-07-17

  Refactoring, updating and `arm64` (M1) support.

  * Libraries depending on ``@loader_path`` are now supported (KB).
  * ``@executable_path`` is supported and defaults to the current Python
    executable path.  This can be changed with the ``--executable-path`` flag
    (KB).
  * The ``--ignore-missing-dependencies`` flag can be given to ignore errors and
    delocate as many dependencies as possible (KB).
  * Dependencies are now delocated recursively (KB).
  * ``delocate.delocating.copy_recurse`` has been deprecated (KB).
  * ``delocate.libsana.resolve_rpath`` has been deprecated (KB).
  * Add required ad-hoc signing for libraries (IF).
  * Fix to escape regexp special characters to occur in library names (such as
    ``++`` in ``libc++`` (Grzegorz Bokota).
  * Support for new ``otool`` output from arm architecture fat libraries (IF).
  * Various CI improvements, including refactoring for test wheel generation,
    replacing ``i386`` with ``arm64`` for dual architectures, and start of
    Github workflow tests (MB, KB).
  * Various documentation fixes (Brad Solomon, Andrew Murray).

* [0.8.2] - 2020-07-12

  Bugfix release.

  * Force UTF-8 for import of README file.  0.8.1 introduced non-ascii
    characters, so unguarded `open('README.rst', 'rt').read()` in `setup.py`
    gives an encoding error.  See GH issue 81.  Thanks to Joshua Haberman for
    the report.

* [0.8.1] - 2020-06-28

  Bugfix release.

  * Adapt parsing of otool output to Catalina, avoiding crash in delocate
    (thanks to Github use `matham` for the report)
  * Adapt to possibility that `wheel` binary is not on PATH.
  * Various improvements to documentation, including explanation of Delocate's
    problems in dealing with single module extensions (Brad Solomon)
  * PEP8 maintenance by Grzegorz Bokota.

* [0.8.0] - 2019-11-06

  Bugfix and new feature release.

  * More extensive search for libraries that code depends on, using macOS path
    search algorithm (Forrest Brennen, Ofan Tester).
  * Fix for newer XCode messages for "not an object" (Andy Wilson)
  * Fixes to Wheel zip file permissions and attributes (Cosimo Lupo and MB).
  * Some Windows path compatibility (Isuru Fernando)
  * Bugfix for use of undefined variable in ``get_install_id`` (Anthony
    Sottile).

* [0.7.4] - 2018-10-01

  Bugfix release to deal with large number of breaking changes in wheel
  0.32.0.

  * Refactor to deal with Wheel 0.32.0, with massive refactoring of the API,
    and the use of zero permissions RECORD file.
  * Refactor to use Pytest (many thanks to Github user Xoviat).
  * Beginning of Windows refactor (Xoviat again).

* [0.7.3] - 2017-12-04

  Also deal with xcode 8.3 message from another binary file.

* [0.7.2] - 2017-12-02

  Make compatible with latest Xcode error messages.

* [0.7.1] - 2017-06-27

  Fix broken tests from 0.7.0.

* [0.7.0] - 2017-06-27

  Add ability to deal with rpath.  Thanks to Kyle Stewart.

* [0.6.5] - 2017-06-16

  More changes for compatibility with newer OSX Xcode messages.  Thanks to
  Sean Gillies.

  * more adaptations to changes to output of ``otool``.

* [0.6.4] - 2016-11-23

  Changes for compatibility with newer OSX.  Thanks to Tommy Sparber.

  * adapt to SIP file protections;
  * adapt to changes in otool output;
  * rebuild testing wheels for OSX 10.6 compatibility.

* [0.6.3] - 2015-07-20

  * Inspect all files looking for linked libraries, instead of inspecting only
    files ending in library extensions.  This means that you will also pick up
    libraries for executables in the given path to delocate, by default, but
    is slower to execute. Thanks to Marc Abramowitz for the report and
    suggestion;
  * Remove silly check for library existence when delocating libraries that
    are in the tree to delocate.

* [0.6.2] - 2014-11-10

  * Bugfix for zipfile unpacking losing permissions; This wiped out useful
    permissions like execute permissions for scripts when modifying zip files.

* [0.6.1] - 2014-10-23

  * Add some useful flags to ``delocate-add-platform``
  * Refactoring

* [0.6.0] - 2014-09-13

  * Add utility to add platform tags to wheel contents and name
  * Add more general wheel context manager
  * Some refactoring for neatness

* [0.5.0] - 2014-07-22

  * Add utilities and script to apply a patch to a wheel
  * Add utilities and script to test for architectures in libraries and
    require named architectures
  * Docstring fixes and refactoring

* [0.4.0] - 2014-06-25

  * Set ``install_name_id`` for copied libraries to be unique to this package.
    OSX uses the ``install_name_id`` to identify a library uniquely on the
    system.  If two libraries have the same ``install_name_id`` when loaded into
    the process, then OSX will raise an error unless their compatibility number
    matches.  Delocate now sets the ``install_name_id`` to be more or less
    unique with a Python process at least.  This means OSX won't raise an error
    if you have two different libraries in two different packages (e.g hdf5
    libraries in ``h5py`` and ``pytables``.
  * Turn on compression for creating wheel zip files. Previously we were zipping
    without compression (because MB didn't know that was the default).
  * Raise an error if delocating attempts to copy two different libraries with
    the same name (therefore overwriting one with the other).
  * Add command and functions to do architecture fuse between two different
    wheels. This can be useful when you have to build a 32-bit and 64-bit wheel
    separately. In that case you can fuse the two wheels making fat (combined)
    architecture libraries, using ``delocate-fuse``.  Add supporting routines
    for detecting architecture of libraries and fusing libraries with different
    architectures.
  * Add use of ``os.path.expanduser`` to specified output wheel directory for
    ``delocate-wheel`` script. Now flag input like ``delocate-wheel -w ~/wheels
    some_wheel.whl`` will correctly output to ``$HOME/wheels``.

* [0.3.0] - 2014-05-05

  * Switch to using just ``@loader_path`` rather than a combination of
    ``@loader_path`` and ``@rpath`` for pointing to relocated libraries.  Using
    ``@rpath`` was giving some errors of form::

        "install_name_tool: changing install names or rpaths can't be redone
        for: libsomething.dylib (for architecture x86_64) because larger updated
        load commands do not fit (the program must be relinked, and you may need
        to use -headerpad or -headerpad_max_install_names)

    |--| presumably because ``@rpath`` had been zero length before we got to the
    library.
  * Add flag to display depending libraries as well as the libraries a tree /
    wheel depends on.
  * Use canonical paths for depended and depending library paths, including
    following symbolic links.  This means that two links pointing to the same
    file don't appear to be two different libraries, causing an error when
    copying the second into the directory containing the copied libraries.
  * Don't raise an error when delocating a wheel that was previously delocated
    (MinRK)

* [0.2.1] - 2014-03-31

  Bugfix release

  * Rewrite wheel RECORD file when writing wheel.  Delocated wheels were
    breaking ``wheel unpack`` command.

* [0.2.0] - 2014-03-25

  First public release
