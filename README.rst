Delocate
########

OSX utilities to:

* find dynamic libraries imported from python extensions
* copy needed dynamic libraries to directory within package
* update OSX ``install_names`` and ``rpath`` to cause code to load from copies
  of libraries

Provides scripts:

* ``delocate-listdeps`` -- show libraries a tree depends on
* ``delocate-path`` -- copy libraries a tree depends on into the tree and relink
* ``delocate-wheel`` -- rewrite wheel having copied and relinked library
  dependencies into the wheel tree.

`auditwheel <https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel>`_ is a tool for Linux
similar to ``delocate``, on which it was based.

***********
The problem
***********

Let's say you have built a wheel somewhere, but it's linking to dynamic
libraries elsewhere on the machine, so you can't distribute it, because others
may not have these same libraries.  Here we analyze the dependencies for a scipy
wheel::

    $ delocate-listdeps scipy-0.14.0b1-cp34-cp34m-macosx_10_6_intel.whl
    /usr/local/Cellar/gfortran/4.8.2/gfortran/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib
    /usr/local/Cellar/gfortran/4.8.2/gfortran/lib/libgfortran.3.dylib
    /usr/local/Cellar/gfortran/4.8.2/gfortran/lib/libquadmath.0.dylib

By default, this does not include libraries in ``/usr/lib`` and ``/System``.
See those too with::

    $ delocate-listdeps --all scipy-0.14.0-cp34-cp34m-macosx_10_6_intel.whl
    /System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/A/Accelerate
    /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib
    /usr/lib/libstdc++.6.dylib
    /usr/local/Cellar/gfortran/4.8.2/gfortran/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib
    /usr/local/Cellar/gfortran/4.8.2/gfortran/lib/libgfortran.3.dylib
    /usr/local/Cellar/gfortran/4.8.2/gfortran/lib/libquadmath.0.dylib

The output tells me that scipy has picked up dynamic libraries from my homebrew
installation of ``gfortran`` (as well as the system libs).

.. warning::

    Dependency paths starting with ``@loader_path/`` or ``@executable_path/``
    are ignored by delocate.  These files will be skipped by the
    ``delocate-wheel`` command.

You can get a listing of the files depending on each of the libraries,
using the ``--depending`` flag::

    $ delocate-listdeps --depending scipy-0.14.0-cp34-cp34m-macosx_10_6_intel.whl
    /usr/local/Cellar/gfortran/4.8.2/gfortran/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib:
        scipy/interpolate/dfitpack.so
        scipy/special/specfun.so
        scipy/interpolate/_fitpack.so
        ...

**********
A solution
**********

We can fix like this::

    $ delocate-wheel -w fixed_wheels -v scipy-0.14.0-cp34-cp34m-macosx_10_6_intel.whl
    Fixing: scipy-0.14.0-cp34-cp34m-macosx_10_6_intel.whl
    Copied to package .dylibs directory:
        /usr/local/Cellar/gfortran/4.8.2/gfortran/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib
        /usr/local/Cellar/gfortran/4.8.2/gfortran/lib/libgfortran.3.dylib
        /usr/local/Cellar/gfortran/4.8.2/gfortran/lib/libquadmath.0.dylib

The ``-w`` flag tells delocate-wheel to output to a new wheel directory instead
of overwriting the old wheel.  ``-v`` (verbose) tells you what delocate-wheel is
doing.  In this case it has made a new directory in the wheel zipfile, named
``scipy/.dylibs``. It has copied all the library dependencies that are outside
the OSX system trees into this directory, and patched the python ``.so``
extensions in the wheel to use these copies instead of looking in
``/usr/local/Cellar/gfortran/4.8.2/gfortran/lib``.

Check the links again to confirm::

    $ delocate-listdeps --all fixed_wheels/scipy-0.14.0-cp34-cp34m-macosx_10_6_intel.whl
    /System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/A/Accelerate
    /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib
    /usr/lib/libstdc++.6.0.9.dylib
    @loader_path/../../../../.dylibs/libgcc_s.1.dylib
    @loader_path/../../../../.dylibs/libgfortran.3.dylib
    @loader_path/../../../../.dylibs/libquadmath.0.dylib
    @loader_path/../../../.dylibs/libgcc_s.1.dylib
    @loader_path/../../../.dylibs/libgfortran.3.dylib
    @loader_path/../../../.dylibs/libquadmath.0.dylib
    @loader_path/../../.dylibs/libgcc_s.1.dylib
    @loader_path/../../.dylibs/libgfortran.3.dylib
    @loader_path/../../.dylibs/libquadmath.0.dylib
    @loader_path/../.dylibs/libgcc_s.1.dylib
    @loader_path/../.dylibs/libgfortran.3.dylib
    @loader_path/../.dylibs/libquadmath.0.dylib
    @loader_path/libgcc_s.1.dylib
    @loader_path/libquadmath.0.dylib

So - system dylibs the same, but the others moved into the wheel tree.

This makes the wheel more likely to work on another machine which does not have
the same version of gfortran installed - in this example.

Checking required architectures
===============================

Current Python.org Python and the OSX system Python (``/usr/bin/python``) are
both dual Intel architecture binaries.  For example::

    $ lipo -info /usr/bin/python
    Architectures in the fat file: /usr/bin/python are: x86_64 i386

This means that wheels built for Python.org Python or system Python should
also have i386 and x86_64 versions of the Python extensions and their
libraries.  It is easy to link Python extensions against single architecture
libraries by mistake, and therefore get single architecture extensions and /
or libraries. In fact my scipy wheel is one such example, because I
inadvertently linked against the homebrew libraries, which are x86_64 only.
To check this you can use the ``--require-archs`` flag::

    $ delocate-wheel --require-archs=intel scipy-0.14.0-cp34-cp34m-macosx_10_6_intel.whl
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "/Users/mb312/.virtualenvs/delocate/bin/delocate-wheel", line 77, in <module>
        main()
    File "/Users/mb312/.virtualenvs/delocate/bin/delocate-wheel", line 69, in main
        check_verbose=opts.verbose)
    File "/Users/mb312/.virtualenvs/delocate/lib/python2.7/site-packages/delocate/delocating.py", line 477, in delocate_wheel
        "Some missing architectures in wheel")
    delocate.delocating.DelocationError: Some missing architectures in wheel

The "intel" argument requires dual architecture extensions and libraries. You
can see which extensions are at fault by adding the ``-v`` (verbose) flag::

    $ delocate-wheel -w fixed_wheels --require-archs=intel -v scipy-0.14.0-cp34-cp34m-macosx_10_6_intel.whl
    Fixing: scipy-0.14.0-cp34-cp34m-macosx_10_6_intel.whl
    Required arch i386 missing from /usr/local/Cellar/gfortran/4.8.2/gfortran/lib/libgfortran.3.dylib
    Required arch i386 missing from /usr/local/Cellar/gfortran/4.8.2/gfortran/lib/libquadmath.0.dylib
    Required arch i386 missing from scipy/fftpack/_fftpack.so
    Required arch i386 missing from scipy/fftpack/convolve.so
    Required arch i386 missing from scipy/integrate/_dop.so
    ...

I need to rebuild this wheel to link with dual-architecture libraries.

Troubleshooting
===============

DelocationError: "library does not exist"
-----------------------------------------

When running ``delocate-wheel`` or its sister command ``delocate-path``, you
may get errors like this::

    delocate.delocating.DelocationError: library "<long temporary path>/wheel/libme.dylib" does not exist

This happens when one of your libraries gives a library dependency with a
relative path.  For example, let's say that some file in my wheel has this for
the output of ``otool -L myext.so``::

    myext.so:
        libme.dylib (compatibility version 10.0.0, current version 10.0.0)
        /usr/lib/libstdc++.6.dylib (compatibility version 7.0.0, current version 60.0.0)
        /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1197.1.1)

The first line means that ``myext.so`` expects to find ``libme.dylib`` at
exactly the path ``./libme.dylib`` - the current working directory from which
you ran the executable.  The output *should* be something like::

    myext.so:
        /path/to/libme.dylib (compatibility version 10.0.0, current version 10.0.0)
        /usr/lib/libstdc++.6.dylib (compatibility version 7.0.0, current version 60.0.0)
        /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1197.1.1)

To set the path to the library, the linker is using the `install name id`_ of
the linked library.  In this bad case, then ``otool -L libme.dylib`` will give
something like::

    libme.dylib (compatibility version 10.0.0, current version 10.0.0)
    /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1197.1.1)

where the first line is the `install name id`_ that the linker picked up when
linking ``myext.so`` to ``libme.dylib``.  You job is to fix the build process
so that ``libme.dylib`` has install name id ``/path/to/libme.dylib``.
This is not a problem specific to ``delocate``; you will need to do this to
make sure that ``myext.so`` can load ``libme.dylib`` without ``libme.dylib``
being in the current working directory.  For ``CMAKE`` builds you may want to
check out CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR_.

External library is not bundled into wheel
------------------------------------------

If your project is structured as a standalone Python module rather
than package, ``delocate-wheel`` may not find the extension modules
that you want to patch::

    $ delocate-wheel -w fixed_wheels -v my-wheel-name.whl
    Fixing: my-wheel-name.whl

The above output is missing a line indicating that an external
shared library was copied into the wheel as intended.

To show this visually, this project layout will **not** work::

    ├── extension_module.cpp
    ├── setup.py
    └── README.md

Instead, ``delocate-wheel`` requires a project organized as a Python
package rather than single standalone module::

    ├── proj/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── extension_module.cpp
    ├── setup.py
    └── README.md

Here, ``__init__.py`` contains::

    from .extension_module import *

Along with this, make sure to include the ``packages`` argument
to ``setup()`` in ``setup.py``::

    # setup.py
    from setuptools import setup, find_packages

    # ...

    setup(
        # ...
        packages=find_packages(),  # or packages=["proj"]
        # ...
    )

After these changes, you should see the dylibs successfully copied in::

    $ delocate-wheel -w fixed_wheels -v my-wheel-name.whl
    Fixing: my-wheel-name.whl
    Copied to package .dylibs directory:
      /usr/local/Cellar/package/1.0/lib/mylib.22.dylib
