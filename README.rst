Delocate
########

macOS utilities to:

* find dynamic libraries imported from python extensions
* copy needed dynamic libraries to directory within package
* update macOS ``install_names`` and ``rpath`` to cause code to load from copies
  of libraries

Provides scripts:

* ``delocate-listdeps`` -- show libraries a tree depends on
* ``delocate-path`` -- copy libraries a tree depends on into the tree and relink
* ``delocate-wheel`` -- rewrite wheel having copied and relinked library
  dependencies into the wheel tree.
* ``delocate-fuse`` -- combine two wheels with different architectures into one
  wheel with dual architecture binaries.

`Auditwheel <https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel>`_ is a similar tool for Linux.
Auditwheel started life as a partial fork of Delocate.

***********
The problem
***********

Let's say you have built a wheel somewhere, but it's linking to dynamic
libraries elsewhere on the machine, so you can't distribute it, because others
may not have these same libraries.  Here we analyze the dependencies for
a Scipy wheel::

    $ delocate-listdeps scipy-0.14.0b1-cp34-cp34m-macosx_10_6_intel.whl
    /usr/local/Cellar/gfortran/4.8.2/gfortran/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib
    /usr/local/Cellar/gfortran/4.8.2/gfortran/lib/libgfortran.3.dylib
    /usr/local/Cellar/gfortran/4.8.2/gfortran/lib/libquadmath.0.dylib

By default, this does not include libraries in ``/usr/lib`` and ``/System``.
See those too with::

    $ delocate-listdeps --all scipy-0.14.0-cp34-cp34m-macosx_10_6_intel.whl
    /System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/A/Accelerate
    /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib
    /usr/lib/libstdc++.6.dylib
    /usr/local/Cellar/gfortran/4.8.2/gfortran/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib
    /usr/local/Cellar/gfortran/4.8.2/gfortran/lib/libgfortran.3.dylib
    /usr/local/Cellar/gfortran/4.8.2/gfortran/lib/libquadmath.0.dylib

The output tells me that Scipy has picked up dynamic libraries from my
Homebrew installation of ``gfortran`` (as well as the system libs).

You can get a listing of the files depending on each of the libraries,
using the ``--depending`` flag::

    $ delocate-listdeps --depending scipy-0.14.0-cp34-cp34m-macosx_10_6_intel.whl
    /usr/local/Cellar/gfortran/4.8.2/gfortran/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib:
        scipy/interpolate/dfitpack.so
        scipy/special/specfun.so
        scipy/interpolate/_fitpack.so
        ...

**********
A solution
**********

We can fix like this::

    $ delocate-wheel -w fixed_wheels -v scipy-0.14.0-cp34-cp34m-macosx_10_6_intel.whl
    Fixing: scipy-0.14.0-cp34-cp34m-macosx_10_6_intel.whl
    Copied to package .dylibs directory:
        /usr/local/Cellar/gfortran/4.8.2/gfortran/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib
        /usr/local/Cellar/gfortran/4.8.2/gfortran/lib/libgfortran.3.dylib
        /usr/local/Cellar/gfortran/4.8.2/gfortran/lib/libquadmath.0.dylib

The ``-w`` flag tells `delocate-wheel` to output to a new wheel directory
instead of overwriting the old wheel.  ``-v`` (verbose) tells you what
`delocate-wheel` is doing.  In this case it has made a new directory in the
wheel zipfile, named ``scipy/.dylibs``. It has copied all the library
dependencies that are outside the macOS system trees into this directory, and
patched the python ``.so`` extensions in the wheel to use these copies instead
of looking in ``/usr/local/Cellar/gfortran/4.8.2/gfortran/lib``.

Check the links again to confirm::

    $ delocate-listdeps --all fixed_wheels/scipy-0.14.0-cp34-cp34m-macosx_10_6_intel.whl
    /System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/A/Accelerate
    /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib
    /usr/lib/libstdc++.6.0.9.dylib
    @loader_path/../../../../.dylibs/libgcc_s.1.dylib
    @loader_path/../../../../.dylibs/libgfortran.3.dylib
    @loader_path/../../../../.dylibs/libquadmath.0.dylib
    @loader_path/../../../.dylibs/libgcc_s.1.dylib
    @loader_path/../../../.dylibs/libgfortran.3.dylib
    @loader_path/../../../.dylibs/libquadmath.0.dylib
    @loader_path/../../.dylibs/libgcc_s.1.dylib
    @loader_path/../../.dylibs/libgfortran.3.dylib
    @loader_path/../../.dylibs/libquadmath.0.dylib
    @loader_path/../.dylibs/libgcc_s.1.dylib
    @loader_path/../.dylibs/libgfortran.3.dylib
    @loader_path/../.dylibs/libquadmath.0.dylib
    @loader_path/libgcc_s.1.dylib
    @loader_path/libquadmath.0.dylib

So - system dylibs the same, but the others moved into the wheel tree.

This makes the wheel more likely to work on another machine which does not have
the same version of Gfortran installed - in this example.

Checking required architectures
===============================

Current Python.org Python and the macOS system Python (``/usr/bin/python``)
are both dual architecture binaries.  For example::

    $ lipo -info /usr/bin/python
    Architectures in the fat file: /usr/bin/python are: x86_64 arm64e

**Note**: you can compile ARM binaries for basic ARM (``arm64``), or to use
some extended ARM capabilities (``arm64e``) - see `this SO post
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52624308/xcode-arm64-vs-arm64e>`_.  Both
types of binaries work on Mac M1 and M2 machines, so we will use ``arm64`` to
refer to either ``arm64`` or ``arm64e``.

The Big Sur macOS Python above has both ``x86_64`` and ``arm64`` (M1) versions
fused into one file.  Earlier versions of macOS had dual architectures that
were 32-bit (``i386``) and 64-bit (``x86_64``).

For full compatibility with system and Python.org Python, wheels built for
Python.org Python or system Python should have the corresponding architectures
â€” e.g. ``x86_64`` and ``arm64`` versions of the Python extensions and their
libraries.  It is easy to link Python extensions against single architecture
libraries by mistake, and therefore get single architecture extensions and /
or libraries. In fact my Scipy wheel is one such example, because I
inadvertently linked against the Homebrew libraries, which were ``x86_64``
only. To check this you can use the ``--require-archs`` flag::

    $ delocate-wheel --require-archs=intel scipy-0.14.0-cp34-cp34m-macosx_10_6_intel.whl
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "/Users/mb312/.virtualenvs/delocate/bin/delocate-wheel", line 77, in <module>
        main()
    File "/Users/mb312/.virtualenvs/delocate/bin/delocate-wheel", line 69, in main
        check_verbose=opts.verbose)
    File "/Users/mb312/.virtualenvs/delocate/lib/python2.7/site-packages/delocate/delocating.py", line 477, in delocate_wheel
        "Some missing architectures in wheel")
    delocate.delocating.DelocationError: Some missing architectures in wheel

Notice that this command was using an earlier version of Delocate that
supported Python 2; we now support Python 3 only.

The ``intel`` argument to ``--require-archs`` above requires dual 32- and 64-
bit architecture extensions and libraries. You can see which extensions are at
fault by adding the ``-v`` (verbose) flag::

    $ delocate-wheel -w fixed_wheels --require-archs=intel -v scipy-0.14.0-cp34-cp34m-macosx_10_6_intel.whl
    Fixing: scipy-0.14.0-cp34-cp34m-macosx_10_6_intel.whl
    Required arch i386 missing from /usr/local/Cellar/gfortran/4.8.2/gfortran/lib/libgfortran.3.dylib
    Required arch i386 missing from /usr/local/Cellar/gfortran/4.8.2/gfortran/lib/libquadmath.0.dylib
    Required arch i386 missing from scipy/fftpack/_fftpack.so
    Required arch i386 missing from scipy/fftpack/convolve.so
    Required arch i386 missing from scipy/integrate/_dop.so
    ...

I need to rebuild this wheel to link with dual-architecture libraries.

Making dual-architecture binaries
=================================

Modern Mac wheels can be either ``arm64`` (M1/M2 ARM), ``x86_64`` (64-bit
Intel) or both (``universal2``).

Building an entire Python wheel as dual-architecture can be difficult, perhaps
because you need to link different libraries in the two cases, or you need
different compiler flags, or because you build for ``arm64`` on one continuous
integration platform (such as - at time of writing - Cirrus CI), and ``x86_64``
on another.

One solution to this problem is to do an entire ``arm64`` wheel build, and then
an entire ``x86_64`` wheel build, and *fuse* the two wheels into a universal
wheel.

That is what the ``delocate-merge`` command does.

Let's say you have built an ARM and Intel wheel, called, respectively:

* ``scipy-1.9.3-cp311-cp311-macosx_12_0_arm64.whl``
* ``scipy-1.9.3-cp311-cp311-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl``

Then you could create a new fused (``universal2``) wheel in the ``tmp``
subdirectory with::

    delocate-merge scipy-1.9.3-cp311-cp311-macosx_12_0_arm64.whl scipy-1.9.3-cp311-cp311-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl -w tmp

The output wheel in that case would be:

* ``tmp/scipy-1.9.3-cp311-cp311-macosx_12_0_universal2.whl``

In the new wheel, you will find, using ``lipo -archs`` - that all binaries with
the same name in each wheel are now universal (``x86_64`` and ``arm64``).

    `:warning:` **Note:** In previous versions (``<0.12.0``) making dual architecture binaries was
    performed with the ``delocate-fuse`` command. This commannd would overwrite the
    first wheel passed in by default. This led to the user needing to rename the
    wheel to correctly describe what platforms it supported. For this and other
    reasons, wheels created with this were often incorrect. From version ``0.12.0``
    and on, the ``delocate-fuse`` command has been removed and replaced with
    ``delocate-merge``. The ``delocate-merge`` command will create a new wheel with an
    automatically generated name based on the wheels that were merged together.
    There is no need to perform any further changes to the merged wheel's name. If
    the old behavior is needed (not recommended), pin the version to
    ``delocate==0.11.0``.

Troubleshooting
===============

DelocationError: "library does not exist"
-----------------------------------------

When running ``delocate-wheel`` or its sister command ``delocate-path``, you
may get errors like this::

    delocate.delocating.DelocationError: library "<long temporary path>/wheel/libme.dylib" does not exist

This happens when one of your libraries gives a library dependency with a
relative path.  For example, let's say that some file in my wheel has this for
the output of ``otool -L myext.so``::

    myext.so:
        libme.dylib (compatibility version 10.0.0, current version 10.0.0)
        /usr/lib/libstdc++.6.dylib (compatibility version 7.0.0, current version 60.0.0)
        /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1197.1.1)

The first line means that ``myext.so`` expects to find ``libme.dylib`` at
exactly the path ``./libme.dylib`` - the current working directory from which
you ran the executable.  The output *should* be something like::

    myext.so:
        /path/to/libme.dylib (compatibility version 10.0.0, current version 10.0.0)
        /usr/lib/libstdc++.6.dylib (compatibility version 7.0.0, current version 60.0.0)
        /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1197.1.1)

To set the path to the library, the linker is using the `install name id`_ of
the linked library.  In this bad case, then ``otool -L libme.dylib`` will give
something like::

    libme.dylib (compatibility version 10.0.0, current version 10.0.0)
    /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1197.1.1)

where the first line is the `install name id`_ that the linker picked up when
linking ``myext.so`` to ``libme.dylib``.  Your job is to fix the build process
so that ``libme.dylib`` has install name id ``/path/to/libme.dylib``.
This is not a problem specific to Delocate; you will need to do this to
make sure that ``myext.so`` can load ``libme.dylib`` without ``libme.dylib``
being in the current working directory.  For ``CMAKE`` builds you may want to
check out CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR_.
