    `lib_path` is a directory containing libraries.  The libraries might

    adjusts the depending libraries to use the copy. It keeps iterating over

    Parameters
    ----------
    lib_path : str
        Directory containing libraries
    copy_filt_func : None or callable, optional
        If None, copy any library that found libraries depend on.  If callable,

    copied_libs : dict
        See :func:`copy_recurse` for definition.

    Notes
    -----
    If we need to copy another library, add that (``depended_lib_path``,
    ``dependings_dict``) to `copied_libs`.  ``dependings_dict`` has (key,
    value) pairs of (``depending_lib_path``, ``install_name``).
    ``depending_lib_path`` will be the original (canonical) library name, not
    the copy in ``lib_path``.

    Sometimes we copy a library, that further depends on a library we have
    already copied. In this case update ``copied_libs[depended_lib]`` with the
    extra dependency (as well as fixing up the install names for the depending
    library).

    For example, imagine we've start with a lib path like this::

        my_lib_path/
            libA.dylib
            libB.dylib

    Our input `copied_libs` has keys ``/sys/libA.dylib``, ``/sys/libB.lib``
    telling us we previously copied those guys from the ``/sys`` folder.

    On a first pass, we discover that ``libA.dylib`` depends on
    ``/sys/libC.dylib``, so we copy that.

    On a second pass, we discover now that ``libC.dylib`` also depends on
    ``/sys/libB.dylib``.  `copied_libs` tells us that we already have a copy of
    ``/sys/libB.dylib``, so we fix our copy of `libC.dylib`` to point to
    ``my_lib_path/libB.dylib`` and add ``/sys/libC.dylib`` as a
    ``dependings_dict`` entry for ``copied_libs['/sys/libB.dylib']``

    require_archs : str or sequence, optional
        Architectures we require to be present in all library files in wheel.
        If an empty sequence, just check that depended libraries do have the
        architectures of the depending libraries, with no constraints on what
        these architectures are. If a sequence, then a set of required
        architectures e.g. ``['i386', 'x86_64']`` to specify dual Intel
        architectures.  If a string, then a standard architecture name as
        returned by ``lipo -info`` or the string "intel", corresponding to the
        sequence ``['i386', 'x86_64']``
    stop_fast : bool, optional
        Whether to give up collecting errors after the first
