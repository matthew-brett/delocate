""" Utilities to fuse trees and wheels

To "fuse" is to merge two binary libraries of different architectures - see
func:`delocate.tools.lipo_fuse`.

The procedure for fusing two trees (or trees in wheels) is similar to updating
a dictionary.  There is a lhs of an update (fuse) called ``to_tree`` and a rhs
called ``from_tree``.  All files present in ``from_tree`` get copied into
``to_tree``, unless [the file is a library AND there is a corresponding file
with the same relative path in ``to_tree``]. In this case the two files are
"fused" - meaning we use ``lipo_fuse`` to merge the architectures in the two
libraries.
