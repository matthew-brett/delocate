    This function is used to search for the real files that are required by

    ----------

    We'll use a single approach here:

        1. Search for the basename of the library on DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
        2. Search for ``realpath(lib_path)``
        3. Search for the basename of the library on DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH

    This follows the order that Apple defines for "searching for a
    library that has a directory name in it" as defined in their
    documentation here:

    https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/DynamicLibraries/100-Articles/DynamicLibraryUsageGuidelines.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001928-SW10

    See the script "testing_osx_rpath_env_variables.sh" in tests/data
    for a more in-depth explanation. The case where LD_LIBRARY_PATH is
    used is a narrow subset of that, so we'll ignore it here to keep
    things simple.
