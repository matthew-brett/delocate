    Use to give form of `lib_dict` that appears relative to some base path
    given by `strip_prefix`.  Particularly useful for analyzing wheels where we
    unpack to a temporary path before analyzing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lib_dict : dict
        See :func:`tree_libs` for definition.  All depending and depended paths
        are canonical (therefore absolute)
    strip_prefix : str
        Prefix to remove (if present) from all depended and depending library
        paths in `lib_dict`

    Returns

        `lib_dict` with `strip_prefix` removed from beginning of all depended
        and depending library paths.

    Use this routine for a dump of the dependency tree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    wheel_fname : str
        Filename of wheel
    filt_func : None or callable, optional
        If None, inspect all non-system files for library dependencies.

    -------
    lib_dict : dict
        dictionary with (key, value) pairs of (``libpath``,

        relative to wheel root path if within wheel tree.  ``dependings_dict``
        is (key, value) of (``depending_lib_path``, ``install_name``).  Again,
        ``depending_lib_path`` is library relative to wheel root path, if

    Raises
    ------
    DelocationError
        When dependencies can not be located and `ignore_missing` is False.
